# angularFromScratch

This repo will house all the code thats on the book "Build Your Own Angular" by Tero Parviainen.
Its a personal project that I've taken to learn deeper parts of angular and maybe, become a better programmer overall. 

Anybody looking to socialize or guide through the process would be greatly appreciated.
